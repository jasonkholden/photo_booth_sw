Install:
sudo apt-get install python-imaging

Running on a Laptop:
% ./photo_booth.py

Running (pi via ssh, needs to run as root for GPIO):
pi% ./run_photo

Rasberry Pi Setup:
photo_booth.py makes use of the /tmp partition.  On a default setup, this
is probably your SD-card, which has slow write performance.  For increased
performance, make this a ramdisk by modifying your /etc/fstab with the
following line and reboot:
tmpfs    /tmp    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=100m    0 0
